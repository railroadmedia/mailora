1 - Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

### 1.1 - Installation

Install using Composer by running 

```
$ composer require railroad/mailora
```

or add to composer.json

```
{
    "require": {
        "railroad/mailora": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

and then run `composer update railroad/mailora`.

(I'm not sure what to do regarding specifying which version to use. Maybe just use "dev-master"?)

run `php artisan vendor:publish`

This will copy view files, the configuration file, and the routes file from the package into your application. Commit these additions.

TODO: IS THIS EVERYTHING ?

### 1.2 - Config for production

#### 1.2.1 - secrets

Define these in your environmental variables as there is no handling for for them via the config file. They shouldn't committed, thus there's no consideration for that.

Provide the required values to your applications config/mail.php file. See Laravel documention for details.

Don't commit your MAIL_PASSWORD, but rather supply it as an environmental variable.

Supply as environmental variables to keep secret:

* "MAIL_PASSWORD"

Hardcode these in the config file:

Configure the 'drive' value of your applications' config/mail.php (can just supply MAIL_DRIVER environmental variable). config/mail.php is a Laravel config file.

(remember that because the config file uses Laravel's "env()" helper function, you can override a hardcoded value at any time by supplying an environmental variable. This can be useful for alternate configurations for local or staging environments.

#### 1.2.2 - non-sensitive

Provide values for the following fields. 

They are defaults when no other value is provided by the request (or any programmatic means on route to the sendingâ€”in a specialized "Mailable" class type for example). This is useful if many there are many places in your application  are sending emails destined for single email address. In such cases, you don't have to then specify the recipient-address. Just leave it blank knowing the Mailora installation is configured to send everything without a recipient-address to that address.

\* with caveatâ€”see note


Note 1: If sender-name provided but not sender-address then sender-name will not be used. This is so that an unintended use of a "name" on an unrelated.

Note 3: if environment is anything other than "production", this must be set, otherwise emails will **not** be sent to any email other than that supplied by the "MAIL_SAFETY_RECIPIENT" environmental variable. If that env-var is not set then no emails will send.

Note 4: If set to boolean `true`, public endpoint can then take a "recipient-address" body param that is not in the "approved-from-public-recipients" list.

Note 5: Example for "approved-from-public-recipients": `['foo@your-domain.com', 'bar@your-domain.com']`

Note 6: if "users-email-set-reply-to" is true, in requests to the route requiring authentication (where a user is available from Laravel's `auth()->user()`), if no "reply-to" is passed in the request, the user's email address will be set. Note though, that you can also specify in any request to *not* use itâ€”thus overriding a `true` value here only when needed.

In the /config/mailora.php file installed in your application by running `composer install`, replace the empty strings with values for use in production.

(tf is "auth_middleware" you ask? See the next section)


These values in config use [Laravel's "env" function](https://laravel.com/docs/master/helpers#method-env) to use constants provided as environmental variables. If those a constant is null, then the value provided to the "env" function.


<!-- todo: ensure "sender" changed to "sender-address" as needed -->
<!-- todo: ensure "sender" changed to "sender-address" as needed -->
<!-- todo: ensure "sender" changed to "sender-address" as needed -->
<!-- todo: ensure "sender" changed to "sender-address" as needed -->
<!-- todo: ensure "sender" changed to "sender-address" as needed -->
<!-- todo: ensure "sender" changed to "sender-address" as needed -->

You can then call these configuration values using [Laravel's config helper](https://laravel.com/docs/master/helpers#method-config):

```php
$senderAddress = config('mail.defaults.sender-address');

$mail = config('mail.defaults');

$senderName = $mail['sender-name'];
```

Thus, you can provide these as environmental variables:

* MAILORA_SAFETY_RECIPIENT
* MAILORA_DEFAULT_RECIPIENT
* MAILORA_APPROVED_FROM_PUBLIC_RECIPIENTS
* MAILORA_DEFAULT_ADMIN
* MAILORA_DEFAULT_TYPE
* MAILORA_NAME_OF_PROD_ENV
* MAILORA_DEFAULT_TYPE
* MAILORA_PUBLIC_FREE_FOR_ALL

But you don't need to. It's better to just set the values for production in the config file, commit that, and then use the environmental variables for local as per below.

#### 1.2.3 - authentication middleware

Supply an array of one or more values as "auth_middleware". Use the key from the "$routeMiddleware" property of your application's App\Http\Kernel class ([configured as per Laravel functionality](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/middleware#registering-middleware)).

For example, if your app/Http/Kernel.php has:

```
    protected $routeMiddleware = [
        'auth' => \WordpressAuthMiddleware::class,
        'auth-special' => \WordpressSpecialAuthMiddleware::class,
        'requires.edge' => \App\Http\Middleware\RequiresEdge::class,
        'requires.edge-or-pack' => \App\Http\Middleware\RequiresPackOrEdge::class,
        'auth.admin' => \WordpressAdminAuthMiddleware::class,
        'auth.executives' => \StatisticsWhiteListFilter::class,
        'auth.shippers' => \App\Http\Middleware\ShippersOrAdmin::class,
    ];
```

then in config/mailora.php you can have this:

```php
return [
    'defaults' => [
        // omitted in the name of brevity
    ],
    'auth_middleware' => ['auth', 'auth-special']
];
```

### 1.3 - Config for local-development


Provide values to .env. You can provide any you want, but the only one that you **must** set is "MAIL_SAFETY_RECIPIENT". There are cases when failure to provide a value to this variable will cause no emails to send. See the note above ("Note 3" in section about configuration variable).

It's also recommended to set "MAIL_DEFAULT_RECIPIENT" and "MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS" to avoid confusing and/or spamming your co-workers.

example:

```
MAIL_SAFETY_RECIPIENT=jonathan+recordeo_local_safety_recipient@drumeo.com
MAIL_DEFAULT_RECIPIENT=jonathan+recordeo_local_default_recipient@drumeo.com
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=system+from_local_dev@recordeo.com
MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER_NAME=Recordeo
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS_PUBLIC=system+public@recordeo.com
```

**Especially important is `MAIL_SAFETY_RECIPIENT`**. This ensures that customers (and fellow team members) are not spammed when you're developing locally. When that variable is set, and the environment is *not* production *all* emails go to that specified address. If that variable is not set, no emails will be sent (so long as environment is *not* "production").


2 - API Reference
------------------------------

There are two endpoints:

1. `POST /mail/` (Publicly accessible)
1. `POST /members/mail/` (User must be authenticated to access this endpoint)

See details below.


### 2.1 - Send email from anywhere

`POST /mail/`

Can be called from publicly-exposed. Can be called from anywhere. Handy for sending emails from support and sales pages.

Recipient cannot be specified. Will be sent to MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS unless MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS_PUBLIC provided. Though, you can set the "Sender name"<!-- change if below is implemented -->

User must be defined in config file "config/mailora.php". If user is not present there, email will not be send to intended recipient but rather a "unauthorized_recipient" email will be sent to the address provided by c.

3 - Miscellaneous Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.1 - About Customized Messages in Responses

The message returned by responsesâ€”whether a 200's "success-message" or a 500's "error-message" default to a value hard-coded in this package. But, they can both be customized. There are two ways to customize these messages:

1. by supplying an installation-specific default in the config file (this will override the hard-coded default). 
2. Second, by supplying a request-specific value in the request body parameters (this will override any defaults). 

See the flowchart below â†“

```
supplied in body params? â†’ yes â†’ use that
â†“
no
â†“
supplied in config? â†’ yeah â†’ use that
â†“
no
â†“
use the one package default
```

Misc notes to incorporate
----------------------------------------------

If you provide a a "general.blade.php" file in the directory returned by config('mailora.views-directory')...


todo: write about config('mailora.mailables-namespace')


todo: need a way to specify laravel root path in case different than standard. ex: drumeo
